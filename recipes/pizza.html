    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Easy Homemade Pizza Dough</p>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.<br>
         You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready <br>
         to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <dl>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <dd>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</dd>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <dd>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives<br>
            the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it <br>
            becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</dd>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>   
        <dd>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because<br>
             it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</dd> 
        <li>Olive Oil</li>  
        <dd>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water.<br>
             This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</dd>   
        <li>Salt</li>    
        <dd>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust),<br>
            and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</dd> 
    </dl>
    <h3>Step by Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get all ingredients and do the pizza pan</li>
        <li>Mix warm water, yeast and sugar.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
